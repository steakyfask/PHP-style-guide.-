# PHP-style-guide.-

The style I follow when writing PHP. 


camelCase for variables and member variable. 

UpperCase for ClassNames, Methods and Functions. 

Curly brackets for conditional statments such as if's while's and for's are written like so.. 

if ($var == true) {

}


Class's functions and methods are written whith the curly brace dropped to the next line like so... 

class MyClass 
{

  protected $var;

  public function __construct() {
  
  }
  
}
